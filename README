 Requirements:
 -------------
   o NVDIA display driver
      *Currently the proprietary NVIDIA driver from the official website
       (under Ubuntu 10.4, cf. http://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/wiki/CUDA_Installation)
       as well as the driver from the repositories (with Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04)
       have been tested successfully.
   o NVML perl bindings
      *The bindigs are required to access the NVML library via Perl. Fetch
       a copy of the bindings from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/~nvbinding/).
       For more information about the NVML library also visit
       http://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml.
   o Perl
   o Required perl modules (should be installed per default under Ubuntu)
     *strict
     *warinings
     *Getopt:Long
     *Switch 
   o Nagios or Icinga


 Installation hints:
 -------------------
   On Ubuntu using the driver from the repositories the file "Makefile.PL" in the 
   nvml package must be modified. Add the parameter '-L/usr/lib/nvidia-current'
   to 'LIBS' in order to get rid of the warning:
   Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lnvidia-ml
   when calling 'perl Makefile.PL'.
