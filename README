 Requirements:
 -------------
   o NVDIA display driver
      * Currently the proprietary NVIDIA driver from the official website
       (under Ubuntu 10.4, cf. http://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/wiki/CUDA_Installation)
       as well as the driver from the repositories (with Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04)
       have been tested successfully.
   o NVML perl bindings
      * The bindigs are required to access the NVML library via Perl. Fetch
       a copy of the bindings from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/~nvbinding/).
       For more information about the NVML library also visit
       http://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml.
   o Perl
   o Required perl modules (should be installed per default under Ubuntu)
     * strict
     * warnings
     * Getopt:Long
     * use feature qw(switch)
       feature switch is available with Perl 5.10.1. The ePN of icinga 1.6.1 showed up
       errors with Switch-Case statements. Therefore it was changed to given-when.
       
     NOT installed per default:
     * Config::IniFiles;
   o Nagios or Icinga

 Installation hints:
 -------------------
   On Ubuntu using the driver from the repositories the file "Makefile.PL" in the 
   nvml package must be modified. Add the parameter '-L/usr/lib/nvidia-current'
   or '-L/usr/lib/nvidia-experimental-304' (for experimental drivers) to 'LIBS'
   in order to get rid of the warning:
   
       Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lnvidia-ml
   
   when calling 'perl Makefile.PL'.

 Notes on sensor warnings:
 -------------------------
 * clocks_throttle_reason_unknown
   This throttle reason can also be reported during PState or clock change
   before driver version r19. Please recheck the throttle reasons with
   $ nvidia-smi -i 0 -q | grep -i throttle -A 5
    Clocks Throttle Reasons
        Idle                    : Not Active
        User Defined Clocks     : Active
        SW Power Cap            : Not Active
        HW Slowdown             : Not Active
        Unknown                 : Not Active
 * fanSpeed
   Currently the sensor "Fan speed" is the speed the fan algorithm tries to
   run the fan. Don't rely on this sensor if you want to know if the fan is
   really working properly.

 Configuration:
 --------------
 * Querying only specific sensors (for performance data):
   ./check_gpu_sensor -d 0 -T GPUTemperature,fanSpeed
   Warning - Tesla K20 [persistenceMode = Warning]|fanSpeed=30;80;95; GPUTemperature=38;85;100;
